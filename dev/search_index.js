It aims to make available in Julia part of the functionalities of the Stata command coefplot. Coefplots.jl is built on PGFPlotsX.jl, which bridges the backend, LaTeX library PGFPlots, and Julia interface. The figures produced with Coefplots can be previewed in notebooks and IDE's, like julia-vscode and Atom-Juno, with the help of PGFPlotsX.jl.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"import Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Coefplots\")","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"note: Prerequisite Installation\nSimilar to the requirments for PGFPlotsX installation, Coefplots.jl requires a LaTeX installation with the PGFPlots package installed,\npdf2svg to generate or preview figures in svg. \npdftoppm for png figures.
